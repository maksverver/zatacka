 128 Moves
        4 bytes: game id
        4 bytes: timestamp
        For each player (controlled by this client):
            X bytes: moves (where X == backlog parameter)
                1: move straight ahead
                2: turn left
                3: turn right

 192 Moves
        4 bytes: game id
        4 bytes: timestamp
        P bytes: player status (where P == number of players)
            0 == dead
            1 == living
        Then for each living player:
            X bytes: last moves (where X == backlog parameter)
                0: unknown
                1: move ahead
                2: turn left
                3: turn right
           NB. the bytes correspond to commands given for timeslot
               timestamp-X through timestamp-1 (inclusive); for negative
               timeslots, moves are set to 0. When moves are not (yet) known,
               moves at the end of the list are set to 0 as well.
