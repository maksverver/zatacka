1.0:
 - name & branding [1.0]
 - SERVER: resolve bug where a player is sometimes killed for no apparent reason

1.1:
 - SERVER: configurable game parameters
 - SERVER: game console (view/change parameters, kick players, etc.)
 - CLIENT: make game window resizable
 - CLIENT: implement proper full screen mode on Windows (how?)

General:
 - clean up code, and make naming conventions (of classes, variables,
   methods, etc.) more consistent. (Also, introduce constants for magic
   numers where appropriate).

Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
    (NB. none of this has been observed so far)
