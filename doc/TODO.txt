General:
 - name & branding [1.0]
 - clean up code, and make naming conventions (of classes, variables,
   methods, etc.) more consistent. (Also, introduce constants for magic
   numers where appropriate).
 - AI interface

Client:
 - proper full screen mode on Windows
 - use proper config path (getenv("HOME"/.appname on UNIX, and ShGetFolderXXX on Win32)
 - (re)store last-used configuration settings
 - better (anti-aliased?) game rendering

Server:
 - more accurate rendering?
   => scale to 2000x2000 resolution
   => draw multiple dots to create more accurate lines
      (Bresenham-style)

 Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
