Test TCP_NODELAY stuff on Windows, then release next beta. 

FIXME:
 - when the server quits, the client is killed (with SIG_PIPE I assume).
   fix this in ClientSocket by passing no-signal-flag to recv() and send()
   (beware: Win32 probably doesn't support that)

1.0:
 - name & branding
 - maybe allow Unicode names

1.1:
 - SERVER: option to block AI players
 - SERVER: configurable game parameters
 - SERVER: game console (view/change parameters, kick players, etc.)
 - maybe add unreliable protocol back in (if this has demonstrable advantages?)
   (See outline in new-network-protocol.txt)

General:
 - clean up code, and make naming conventions (of classes, variables,
   methods, etc.) more consistent. (Also, introduce constants for magic
   numers where appropriate).

Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
    (NB. none of this has been observed so far)
  - Server sometimes kills players for no apparent reasons; debugging shows that 
    this occurs because floating-point arithmetic in field_line sometimes yields
    unexpectedly large values (or maybe infinity/NaN); this is non-reproducable so
    it may be a hardware/platform bug (it only occurs on one system).
