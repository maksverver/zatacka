General:
 - name & branding [1.0]
 - clean up code, and make naming conventions (of classes, variables,
   methods, etc.) more consistent. (Also, introduce constants for magic
   numers where appropriate).

Client:
 - proper full screen mode on Windows
 - make game window resizable [1.0]

Server:
 - server console [1.1]

 Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
