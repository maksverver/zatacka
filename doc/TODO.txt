General:
 - name & branding [1.0]
 - clean up code, and make naming conventions (of classes, variables,
   methods, etc.) more consistent. (Also, introduce constants for magic
   numers where appropriate).

Client:
 - make player keys configurable [1.0]
 - (re)store last-used configuration settings

Server:
 - use FIONBIO to set sockets to non-blocking (MSG_DONTWAIT doesn't work
   on Windows)

 Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
