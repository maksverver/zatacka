General:
 - allow multiple players per client (2)
 - send score board update after a player dies

Client:
 - create start-up GUI to configure server and keys (1)
 - make resolution configurable (3)
 - support full-screen (3)

Server:
 Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players structure. If a new client connects, this structure is
    reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
