General:
 - holes in snakes
 - support in-game chat
 - optional: keep player colors between rounds

Client:
 - move client asynchronously (so gameplay is smooth even if
   ping or packet loss is high)
 - make player keys configurable
 - (re)store last-used configuration settings

Server:
 Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
