General:
 - send score board update after a player dies
 - keep player colors between rounds
 - holes in snakes

Client:
 - create start-up GUI to configure server and keys (1)
 - make resolution configurable (3)
 - support full-screen (3)
 - refactor client so the GameView and ScoreView share a common model,
   and the main functions only update this model (and notifiy the views)

Server:
 - Mask SIGPIPE!

 Potential bug:
  - When a client is disconnected, it may have players active, which are pointed
    to by the g_players array. If a new client connects, the active player
    structure is reset, which may cause weird behaviour in the server.
